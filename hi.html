OFFICIAL RULES AND INFORMATION FOR WAC ASSETTO CORSA LEAGUE

1. LEAGUE INFORMATION

1.1 General League Information 
The WAC AC League is a sim-racing league aimed from beginners to dedicated racers alike. The league is divided into two divisions, the WAC Fun Cup and the WAC GT League. The WAC Fun Cup season will feature 4 rounds and the WAC GT League season will feature 6 rounds, with more information being found in <#1400224802337460355>. Both the Fun Cup and GT League races will be available to watch here: <https://twitch.tv/monkeychild9998>.

2. DRIVER AND VEHICLE INFORMATION

2.1 Driver Class Qualification 
Prior to the season's commence, drivers will undergo a time trial to determine whether they will be racing in a GT3 or GT4 car. Those who got a time within the top 50% will be allowed to participate in GT3, with the bottom half being reserved for GT4. If a driver did not make a time during this time trial, then they must run in a GT4 car.

2.2 Available Vehicles
As mentioned in 2.1 Driver Class Qualification, drivers are only allowed to driver cars which they qualified for. Drivers are free to use whichever car within their class. For the GT3 class, we are using the GT-M pack from Race Sim Studio, and for the GT4 class we are using the GT4 car pack from Guerilla Mods. Both of these packs include almost every car from each major manufacturer.

2.3 Balance of Performance 
Just like in real life racing, we will be using a system of BoP. BoP is used to remove any advantages that one car may possess to the others, and makes lap times between cars close with one another. BoP will be changed each round to accommodate specific tracks to ensure the cars are as equal as possible.

2.4 Content 
Links to all necessary content needed, such as tracks, will be published beforehand. ALL CONTENT MUST BE HOW IT WAS WHEN DOWNLOADED, AND CHEATING THROUGH THE MANIPULATION OF FILES WILL RESULT IN A DISQUALIFICATION OR A BAN.

2.5 Custom Liveries
Drivers are allowed to run custom liveries, however they must be approved by a steward or staff member beforehand. Liveries cannot include obscene content or be run without permission without risking disqualification or a ban.

3. RACE INFORMATION

3.1 WAC Fun Cup Race Structure
WAC Fun Cup races will usually be held prior to the GT League races. The round will start with a 10 minute qualifying session to determine the starting position. Once finished, a 30 minute race will commence. 

3.2 WAC GT League Race Structure 
Usually, once the Fun Cup race has ended, after a few hours the GT League race will start. The round will start with a 15 minute qualifying session for both GT3 and GT4 cars which will determine the starting position of drivers in both classes. Following qualifying, a 45 minute race will commence with an additional lap being added once the time has passed.

*A period of around 3-5 minutes will be placed both before and in-between sessions to allow for players to connect to the server in time.*

3.3 Qualifying 
We will be running the amount of cars which the track can hold, meaning if the track has 40 pit slots, only around 38 drivers would be eligible to race (1-2 slots will be used by the broadcaster and safety car driver). For the GT League, half of the available slots will be granted to the GT3 field, with the other half being saved for the GT4s (should the number of slots be odd, an extra slot will be granted to the GT3 field). If the number of drivers entering the race is more than the amount of available slots available, then drivers will become eliminated to accommodate the available space. The drivers eliminated will be determined by qualifying times, with the slowest being eliminated from competing in the race.

3.4 Pit Stops
Drivers competing in the GT League will be required to make at least one pit stop during the race. This pit stop must be made during the pit window which will open after 20 minutes of the race time has elapsed for GT4 drivers and 25 minutes for GT3 drivers. Each pit window will only last 5 minutes and the start and end of the window will be announced. Drivers may pit outside of the pit window, HOWEVER, it will not count towards the mandatory pit stop and they MUST pit again during the window.

3.5 Points Structure
After the conclusion of the race, and the official results have been calculated and published, points will be awarded through the following criteria:

1st - 30 points
2nd - 25 points
3rd - 22 points
4th - 20 points
5th - 18 points
6th - 16 points
7th - 14 points
8th - 12 points
9th - 10 points
10th - 8 points
11th - 6 points
12th - 4 points
13th - 3 points
14th - 2 points
15th - 1 point

Drivers will receive an additional point if they successfully finish the race, and the driver with the fastest lap will also receive an extra point.

4. DRIVING STANDARDS, INFRACTIONS, AND PENALTIES

4.1 Track Limits
The track limits used will be the limits determined by the track's creator. Should a driver violate track limits during qualifying, their time will become deleted. During the race, drivers will be allowed 3 accidental cuts before being served a drive-through penalty. If a driver commits a cut intentionally, they may be given a time penalty or drive through penalty depending on severity. No matter if the cut was small or big, intentional or not, if a driver overtakes a driver whilst violating track limits, they MUST return the position in a timely manner or else a penalty will be given. If a driver was forced off the track by another competitor, the affected driver will not be penalized, however, the driver guilty for forcing the other driver off the track may risk additional penalties. 

4.2 Driving Etiquette
Drivers must show clean and respectful driving at all times. Small amounts of contact is fine, however, if the contact results in a crash, penalties may be given. Intentional wrecking WILL result in heavy penalties such as a black flag, future race bans, or a straight expulsion from the WAC League and all further events.

4.3 Defending and Overtaking 
Drivers defending from a potential overtake must always leave at least a car-lengths width for the overtaking car. Failing to give space, or driving cars off the track may result in penalties. When defending, cars are only given ONE lane change to defend their position. Once this lane change has been made, no more changes can be made without risking a penalty for weaving. During braking, the defending car CANNOT change their lane during braking. Should an incident be caused through the violation of these rules, penalties WILL be given.

When overtaking on a straight, the attacking car must do so in a safe manner, and must ensure they do not cut across the lane of the defending driver until they have fully cleared the car. If the attacking car comes across on the defending driver and causes contact, penalties may be given to the attacking driver. When overtaking on a corner, the attacking car MUST be at least halfway alongside the defending driver in order to be entitled to the racing line. However, if the attacking car gets to this position through aggressive divebombs and/or contact, penalties may be given especially if the contact results in a crash. If the attacking car is LESS than halfway alongside the defending car, then they are not entitled to the racing line. If contact is made and a crash occurs penalties may be given to the attacking driver.

4.4 Overtaking Slow Cars and Blue Flags
During qualifying, it is the driver's duty to position themselves in a position on track which will not result in impeding. If a driver spins out or has a lap invalidated, they MUST yield to all oncoming cars for the lap.

During the race, slower cars, such as GT4 cars, given the blue flag are NOT forced to yield their position. It is the duty of the faster car to overtake in a safe manner. However, the slower MUST stay on a predictable line on track, which is recommended to be the standard racing line. It is encouraged for GT4 drivers to yield to faster GT3 traffic, however, they must stay on a predictable line, and if an incident occurs due to unpredictable driving, penalties will be given. Lapped cars within the driver's class, much like lower class traffic, are not required to give the position. However, lapped cars cannot make egregious or aggressive efforts to defend against an overtake and it is often recommended that they yield to oncoming traffic to avoid penalties.

4.5 Crashes 
Crashes will be reviewed on a case by case basis by the WAC Stewards. Wrecks will be categorized into one of the following:

Punishable Offense: One of the involved drivers is guilty for causing a collision, and will receive disciplinary action. If the driver guilty cannot be impaired in the same race to the degree of his action(s) (ex: wrecked himself while wrecking another driver and DNF'ed), they will receive the penalty during a future event or an immediate points deduction. It does not matter whether the contact was accidental and non malicious, the guilty driver will still receive a penalty. However, if it is found the contact was intentional, heavier penalties may be given out.

Racing Incident: Either no driver is truly at fault for the incident, or all drivers involved are guilty to the same degree. Usually no penalty will be given.

If a car spins or wrecks by itself, the driver MUST apply the brakes and stay in their position until all cars nearby pass. If the car is positioned on the racing line, or in a blind corner, the wrecked driver must safely attempt to move to a less vulnerable position. If a car ends up outside the track due to a wreck, THE CAR MUST REJOIN THE TRACK SAFELY. IF THE DRIVER REJOINS AGGRESSIVELY AND/OR UNSAFELY, THE DRIVER WILL RECEIVE A PENALTY, ESPECIALLY IF IT RESULTS A COLLISION.

4.6 Penalties
The penalties issued by the stewards are the following: 

5 second time penalty
10 second time penalty
Drive through penalty
Stop and go penalty
Black flag disqualification from the race

Stewards may also give the following for upcoming events:

3 place grid drop at event's start
5 place grid drop at event's start
Driver start at back of the grid
Banning from event(s).

The severity of the penalty will correlate with the severity of the incident, and may be slightly modified if the severity of the incident falls in-between the severity of a penalty.

4.7 Pit Lane
Before entering pit lane, drivers must drive within the designated pit entry lines. A driver cannot stay out and cut across the track to make it to pit lane. Similarly to pit entry, drivers must also adhere to the pit exit lines once they exit pit lane. Should a driver violate these limits, penalties will be given. 

On pit road, drivers must adhere to the predetermined pit speed limit. WAC events will utilize the Real Penalty app which will log any instances of pit road speeding. Speeding in pit road will result in penaltisation. 

Drivers must stay on one lane at all times during pit road. Drivers cannot weave or move erratically. When pulling into a pit stall, drivers must check no one is coming out of their own stall at the same time to avoid contact. Likewise when coming out, drivers must check no one close is coming into their own stall.

If a driver misses their stall by a small margin such, as braking too early or late within their pit area, drivers are allowed to forward or reverse into their stall, however, they must do so in a safe manner. If a driver completely misses their stall, such as forgetting to turn into their stall completely and fully passing it, drivers must drive completely through pit road and attempt to pit again. If this occurs during the pit window and the window ends before the driver can pit again, the driver will not be given another opportunity and will be penalized for failing to adhere to the required one stop.

If an incident occurs through violation of any of the mentioned rules, a penalty will be served to the offending driver. 

4.8 Steward Reviews
Stewards will be watching the race live and giving out penalities when necessary. If a driver would like for a specific incident to be reviewed, they can make a request in <#1268934922031333427>. REQUESTS MUST BE MADE NO LATER THAN 12 HOURS FOLLOWING THE END OF THE RACE. The driver MUST send a recording of the following:

An in-car view which clearly shows steering position.
The in-car view of any drivers which were involved.
An outside aerial view of the incident, preferably from the broadcast cams.

In addition, the driver MUST show all pedal inputs, through the AC pedals app or any app similar, of both themselves and any driver involved.

If the driver sends in a request that was intended to just waste everyone's time, they will receive penalties. 

If disciplinary action is made due to a request, both the driver that made the request and the punished driver will be notified.

24 hours following the conclusion of the race, the official results will be published which will take into account any post-race penalties.

These are the official WAC AC League rules and information. All decisions will made be following these rules, and it is recommended for all drivers to read these rules prior to their first race.
